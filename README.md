# Vacation-Tracking-System (VTS)

## Project Vision
### A Vacation Tracking System (VTS) will provide individual employees with the capability to manage their own vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off, without having to be an expert in company policy or the local facilityâ€™s leave policies.
### The main goal of this application is to improve the internal business processes of this organization, at least with respect to the time it takes to manage vacation time requests.
