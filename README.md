# Vacation-Tracking-System (VTS)

## Project Vision
A Vacation Tracking System (VTS) will provide individual employees with the capability to manage their own vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off, without having to be an expert in company policy or the local facilityâ€™s leave policies. 
The main goal of this application is to improve the internal business processes of this organization, at least with respect to the time it takes to manage vacation time requests.

### This system has the potential to save time and money mostly in the HR department, which is essentially taken out of the individual time request process and replaced by a rules-based validation system. HR personnel are still responsible for entering and updating employee vacation data in the system; however, they will no longer be a link in the chain for requesting and validating each time request.
