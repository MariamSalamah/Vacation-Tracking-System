# Vacation-Tracking-System (VTS)

## Project Vision
A Vacation Tracking System (VTS) will provide individual employees with the capability to manage their own vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off, without having to be an expert in company policy or the local facility’s leave policies.
The main goal of this application is to improve the internal business processes of this organization, at least with respect to the time it takes to manage vacation time requests.
## Functional Requirements
1. 

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Usability**: The system must be easy to use
2. 

## Constraints

## Domain (Problem definition)
For many businesses today, the independence of workers has been ever increasing. 
It is not uncommon for workers to divide their time across multiple projects and to report to multiple project managers. 
As a result, managers have fewer informal interactions with their workers and find it
increasingly difficult to be aware of and manage their workers’ vacation time.
In the past, all vacation time had to be approved by an immediate manager and then checked by a clerk in the HR department before it was authorized. Sometimes this manual process could take days. An automated system will speed up this process and will require at most one manual approval by the immediate manager (some high-level employees may not require manager approval).

## Actors of the system
- **Employee**: The main user of this system. An employee uses this system to manage his or her vacation time.
- **Manager**: An employee who has all the abilities and goals of a regular employee, but with the added responsibility of approving vacation requests for immediate subordinates. A manager may award subordinates comp time, subject to certain limits set in the system.
- **HR Clerk**: A member of the HR department who has sufficient rights to view employees’ personal data and is responsible for ensuring that employees’ information in all HR systems is up to date and correct. An HR clerk can add or remove nearly any record in the system.
- **System Admin**: A role responsible for the smooth running of the system’s technical resources (e.g., Web server, database) and for collecting and archiving all log files.
